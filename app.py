# --- Page Configuration (Must be the first Streamlit command) ---
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Gemini's Garden", # Updated title
    page_icon="ðŸ§ ",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)

# --- Minimalist App Entry Point --- 
# This file now primarily serves to set the page config.
# Streamlit automatically discovers and lists files in the 'pages/' directory
# in the sidebar for navigation.

# You could add a simple landing page message here if desired,
# but it's often cleaner to let the first page in the 'pages/'
# directory (sorted alphabetically, e.g., 00_Main_Chat.py) be the default view.

st.title("Welcome to Gemini's Garden")
st.write("Please select a page from the sidebar to begin.")

# Example: Applying theme globally (optional, can also be done per-page)
# from utils.themes import apply_theme
# if "current_theme" not in st.session_state:
#     st.session_state.current_theme = "Dark Purple" # Your default theme
# css = apply_theme(st.session_state.current_theme)
# st.markdown(css, unsafe_allow_html=True)

# --- Authentication Check (Optional - Keeping it simple for now) ---
# We are bypassing authentication for now to use the multipage structure directly.
# To re-enable authentication later (e.g., Google OAuth), you would:
# 1. Uncomment the import: from utils.google_auth import check_login, logout_user
# 2. Uncomment the call: check_login()
# 3. Add a logout button to the sidebar (conditionally if logged in)

# --- Database Initialization (Optional - can be done per-page if needed) ---
# from utils.database import init_db
# init_db() # Initialize DB tables if needed globally

# The rest of the UI and application logic is now handled by the files 
# in the 'pages/' directory (e.g., pages/00_Main_Chat.py).
